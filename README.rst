Spectral integration and differentiation algorithms (SPIDA). This project implements several
high-level wrappers for spectral transforms:

#. Fast-Fourier Transforms (FFTs) 
#. Fast Discrete Cosine Transforms (FDCTs) 
#. Hankel-Transforms  

SPIDA also contains adaptive-step Runge-Kutta numerical propagators for stiff partial-differential-equations (PDEs).
These are the same methods as implemented for the python package `rkstiff <https://github.com/whalenpt/rkstiff>`_.
Two types of numerical methods are available, integrating factor methods (IF), and exponential time-differencing (ETD).
In particular, the solvers provided are

* ETD35 (5th order ETD with 3rd order embedding)
* ETD34 (4th order ETD with 3rd order embedding) 
* IF34 (4th order IF with 3rd order embedding)
* IF45DP (5th order IF with 4th order embedding)

In general, one should prefer ETD35 as it often has the best speed and stability for diagonal systems.
Non-diagonal methods are not implemented as of yet (see the python package for this functionality).
A detailed discussion of these suolvers is provided in the journal article |article|_.
